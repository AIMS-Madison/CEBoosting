# Causation Entropy Boosting

This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [CEBoosting: Online Sparse Identification of Dynamical Systems with Regime Switching by Causation Entropy Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07863)

In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. 
We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). 
Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.
